# AI Generated Universal Synthetic Image Detection

A research project focused on detecting **AI-generated synthetic images** using deep learning and explainable AI techniques. This project implements a baseline detector using **VGG16**, evaluates it on the **CiFake dataset**, and explores **artifact explainability using Grad-CAM and LLM-based interpretation**.

---

# Project Overview

Recent advances in **Generative AI** such as GANs and diffusion models allow the creation of highly realistic synthetic images. While these technologies have many positive applications, they also introduce risks including:

- misinformation
- identity manipulation
- deepfake media
- digital fraud

Traditional fake image detectors often fail to **generalize across different generative models** and provide **little interpretability**.

This project aims to develop a **universal synthetic image detection framework** capable of:

- detecting AI-generated images across multiple generative models
- identifying **visual artifacts** introduced by generative networks
- providing **interpretable explanations** for model predictions

---

# Current Milestone Implementation

The current milestone implements a **complete baseline detection pipeline**.

Pipeline workflow:

```
Dataset Preparation
        ↓
Image Preprocessing
        ↓
VGG16 CNN Training
        ↓
Model Evaluation
        ↓
Confusion Matrix Analysis
        ↓
Grad-CAM Visualization
        ↓
LLM Artifact Explanation
```

This baseline establishes the **experimental infrastructure** for developing the final universal detection architecture.

# Dataset

The project uses the **CiFake Dataset**, which contains both **real images** and **AI-generated synthetic images**.

Dataset structure used in the project:

```
dataset/
    train/
        real/
        fake/
    validation/
        real/
        fake/
    test/
        real/
        fake/
```

Images are resized to:

```
224 × 224
```

to match the input requirements of the VGG16 architecture.

# Model Architecture

The baseline detector uses **Transfer Learning with VGG16**.

Architecture:

```
Input Image (224x224x3)
        ↓
Pretrained VGG16 Convolution Layers
        ↓
Global Pooling
        ↓
Fully Connected Layers
        ↓
Sigmoid Output Layer
        ↓
Binary Classification
        (Real vs Fake)
```

### Training Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|------|
| Model | VGG16 (Pretrained ImageNet) |
| Image Size | 224 × 224 |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Loss Function | Binary Cross Entropy |
| Task | Real vs Fake Classification |

---

# Model Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:

- Classification accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- Prediction confidence

The confusion matrix helps identify:

- **True Positives** – correctly detected fake images
- **True Negatives** – correctly detected real images
- **False Positives** – real images incorrectly labeled as fake
- **False Negatives** – synthetic images classified as real

These results provide insight into **model reliability and failure cases**.

---

# Explainability with Grad-CAM

Deep neural networks often behave as **black-box models**. To interpret predictions, the project integrates **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**.

Grad-CAM highlights the **image regions most responsible for a prediction**.

Example insights:

- irregular textures
- unnatural edges
- high-frequency artifact regions
- inconsistent patterns

These visual explanations help identify **synthetic artifacts introduced by generative models**.

---

# Artifact Interpretation Using LLM

To further improve interpretability, the project integrates a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.

The LLM analyzes:

- model prediction confidence
- Grad-CAM heatmaps
- artifact regions

and produces **human-readable explanations** describing why the image is likely synthetic.

Example explanation:

> “The classifier detected irregular high-frequency textures and unnatural structural patterns consistent with artifacts produced by generative models.”
